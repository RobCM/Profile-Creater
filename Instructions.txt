In order to use upload the files (index.html and assets folder) to you web hosting provider.

* Do not upload this instructions text file.

* To change the images use for avatars upload you new images to the folder name avatars inside 
the assets folder. images most be 100 x 126 and most have the same name.png in order for them 
to be found by the code.

* To change the title (Create Profile! ) open the main.js code with you favorite code compiler (I use nopad++)
The main.js is located on the assets folder.
In the line code:   formHTML = "<div id =\"boxTitle\"><center>Create Profile!</center></div>" +
you change it to:   formHTML = "<div id =\"boxTitle\"><center>What ever title you will like</center></div>" +
Same process to change the tile on (Your Profile!) but changes are made on 
the line code:  profileHTML = "<div id =\"boxTitle\"><center>Your Profile!</center></div>" +
